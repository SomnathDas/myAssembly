DB -> Define Byte -> 1 Byte
DW -> Define Word -> 2 Bytes
DD -> Define Double Word -> 4 Bytes
DQ -> Define QWord -> 6 Bytes
DT -> Define TWord -> 10 Bytes

Inconsistent Data Size:

num DB 1 (DB -> 1 byte -> 8bits)
num DB 2 (DB -> 1 byte -> 8bits)

while storing these data into registers such as eax,ebx,ecx
(e => extended) -> eax = ebx = ecx = .. = 32 bits in capacity
ax = bx = cx = .. = 16bits in capacity
ah = Upper 8bits of 16bits
al = Lower 8bits of 16bits

Make sure you keep data-sizes consistent

-> Be careful as to where you are placing our values in ah and al
-> If working with ah,al together then it is fine
-> Just use al,bl,cl if using individually
-> If you set ah to some value and then check ax it will differ if you change al instead

Take-away:
1. If you are working with whole 32bits then you use eax,ebx,ecx etc
2. If you are wroking with 16bits then you use ax,bx,cx etc
3. If you are working with 8bits then you use ah,al ,, bh,bl etc
